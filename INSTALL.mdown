# Installation

## OpenCV on gorgon

See the [wiki page](https://github.com/sameeptandon/sail-car-log/wiki/Installing-opencv-on-gorgon).

## OpenCV on OS X

If playing the video using `ProjectMapOnVideo.py` is very slow on OS X,
you may need to install OpenCV with Qt4:

`port install opencv +qt4 +tbb +eigen +opencl +python27`
