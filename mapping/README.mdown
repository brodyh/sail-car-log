## Running Car Detection

- Build `mapping`
- Modify `pipeline_config.py` settings
- Run `python pipeline.py convert_h5_to_pcd`
- Run `./detect_cars --out out_video.avi` from the `mapping/bin` folder

Plane fitting and clustering should just work, but may want to tweak `FILTER_RANGE` in `pipeline_config.py` if get clusters outside of the road.
